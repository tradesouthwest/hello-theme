== Guidelines for making a theme for ClassicPress CMS ==

These files can be used to help theme authors get the basics that are involved in starting on creating
themes for ClassicPress. ClassicPress does not have a repository, like WordPress, but we do have a directory 
that is for authors to be able to have a centralized place to keep their working uri for themes and plugins releases.

Best practice for hosting themes, unlike WP, is to "self-host" your themes and plugins on a Github.com repository.
Once you have a working copy of your theme, you can then create a new Release [1] and login to your ClassicPress.net 
account to add the Release url to the ClassicPress directory. https://directory.classicpress.net
