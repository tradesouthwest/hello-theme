== Guidelines for making a theme for ClassicPress CMS ==

Hello-theme is a ClassicPress CMS, helper for building themes for ClassicPress.

== Description ==

These files can be used to help theme authors get the basics that are involved in starting on creating
themes for ClassicPress. ClassicPress does not have a repository, like WordPress, but we do have a directory 
that is for authors to be able to have a **centralized place to keep their working uri** for themes and plugins releases.

Best practice for hosting themes, unlike WP, is to "self-host" your themes and plugins on a Github.com repository.
Once you have a working copy of your theme, you can then create a new Release`[1]` and login to your ClassicPress.net 
account to add the Release url to the ClassicPress directory. https://directory.classicpress.net 

Additional reading to help **speed up the review process** and allow you to run the CPCS (PHPCS) test on your own: https://github.com/ClassicPress/dev-workflows`[3]`

There is a theme unit data xml file for testing themes which does not have the WP blocks or any of the odd-ball WP test data that is not pertinent to CP. You can download it here: https://github.com/tradesouthwest/classicpress-helpers
